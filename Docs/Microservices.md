# Voting System Microservice Overview

## 1. Election Authority Microservice
- **Role**: Responsible for managing and issuing **trusted certificates** for the voting block (e.g., state, union, club, etc). This service ensures that each voter registrar has the necessary authority to issue valid voter certificates.
- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - Manage root certificates.
  - Issue certificates for voter registrars.
  - Secure communication with other services for certificate validation.
  - Provide APIs for the voter registrar to validate certificates during the voting process.

## 2. Voter Registrar Microservice
- **Role**: The **voter registrar** is responsible for registering voters and issuing **voter certificates**. Each certificate is valid for a specified period (e.g., 4 years) and contains a unique identifier (GUID or serial number).
- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - Register voters and store their details.
  - Issue **voter certificates** signed by the **Election Authority**.
  - Validate voters during the election process.
  - Manage certificate expiration and renewal.

## 3. Voting Microservice
- **Role**: Handles the **voting process**, ensuring that ballots are securely cast, signed, and stored.
- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - Generate a **Ballot Certificate** when a voter casts their vote.
  - Ensure that votes are signed using the voter's Ballot Certificate for verification.
  - Record a voter's voting status to prevent double voting.
  - Ensure anonymity by detaching the voter’s identity from the ballot certificate.
  - Store each **eBallot** (signed ballot) in a secure, encrypted database.
  - Provide APIs to verify the integrity of votes via **standard PKI tools**.

## 4. eBallot Storage and Validation Microservice
- **Role**: Securely store **eBallots** and provide validation of the ballots after they are cast.
- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - Store each eBallot with its unique identifier.
  - Ensure eBallots are encrypted and accessible only for validation.
  - Provide APIs for post-election validation using PKI tools to confirm that the eBallot hasn’t been altered.
  - Support indefinite validation of eBallots, even after the **eBallot certificate** expires.

## 5. Database Microservice
- **Role**: Maintain the central database that stores voter registration information, voting statuses, and eBallots.
- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - Store voter data and manage the association of voters with their certificates.
  - Log which voters have cast votes to prevent duplicate voting.
  - Store encrypted eBallots and associated metadata.
  - Ensure fault tolerance, scalability, and security for voter data and ballots.

## 6. Audit and Reporting Microservice
- **Role**: Provide functionality for election auditing and reporting.
- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - Generate reports on voter turnout, ballot counts, and results.
  - Ensure that all actions taken by microservices are logged and auditable.
  - Provide APIs for election officials to verify that the voting process adhered to the defined security and integrity protocols.

## Microservice Communication
- Each microservice communicates securely via **APIs**, using **encrypted channels** and **PKI** to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Events** and **message queues** (e.g., using RabbitMQ, Kafka, or NATS) could be used for real-time processing and triggering actions across services.

## Conclusion

This **microservice architecture** provides flexibility, scalability, and strong security to handle millions of users in a distributed voting system while ensuring data integrity and voter anonymity.
